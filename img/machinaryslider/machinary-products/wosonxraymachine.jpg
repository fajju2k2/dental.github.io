:23:49,594
...it's all about me.

219
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,184
Hello?

220
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,689
Look, just hang on.

221
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,736
Yeah?

222
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,114
I'll be right up.

223
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,411
- What?
- I gotta go.

224
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,290
What? Am I supposed to clean all this
on my own?

225
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,628
Hey.

226
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,050
God...

227
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,739
Buenos dias, ladies, buenos dias.

228
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,490
Do you speak English?

229
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,202
- No.
- No, okay.

230
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,080
Help, help.

231
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,925
I need help to clean. Yes.

232
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,149
- Yes, muy bueno. it's just this...
- No.

233
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,488
No, no, no.

234
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,914
No, no, ladies.

235
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,222
Let me see, let me see. I tell you what.
I tell you what. Look, look.

236
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,140
Universal language.

237
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,314
This one for you. Yeah, sí.

238
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:52,026
Sí, Presidente Grant.
Very important man.

239
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,992
Mas dinero after the...

240
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,079
Are we good?

241
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:07,542
I think we're good. I think we listened
to you. Please, por favor, por favor.

242
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,672
Please, por favor, por favor.

243
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,508
Yes.

244
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,210
What's the deal?

245
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:03,843
Well, the deal is,
we're watching that house.

246
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,138
Couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

247
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,182
Yeah? What for?

248
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,767
A little birdie told me
there's some guys...

249
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,188
...that have 3 pounds of our product
which they're selling.

250
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,649
And which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

251
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,695
So, what's the plan?

252
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,323
I just told you.

253
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,242
We sit here and watch that house...

254
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,245
...until one of our entrepreneurs
pops his head out.

255
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,124
Then we ask a few questions
and get our property back.

256
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,212
Why don't you just go
break the door down...

257
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,340
...pistol-whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

258
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:47,053
Because a little birdie also told me
these guys are into the product...

259
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,347
...and most likely armed.

260
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,059
Now, what you may not know
about meth-heads...

261
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,436
Or maybe you do.

262
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,022
They're kind of unpredictable.

263
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,235
I don't care for unpredictable.
So we wait.

264
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:08,115
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,
but that's 90 percent of the job.

265
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:13,287
Don't worry. I brought sandwiches.

266
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,875
Yes, sir.

267
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,924
Pimento cheese. How's that sound?

268
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,808
Where you going?

269
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,979
You said they're selling right?
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

270
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,071
Who the hell are you?

271
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,615
- Tucker! Tucker!
- I'm here to buy.

272
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,368
- Will you shut the damn door?
- Not my question.

273
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,330
Name's Diesel. Heard you
maybe had some of the blue.

274
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,208
- Tucker. Shut the door, Tucker! Tucker!
- I just...

275
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,086
- Just looking for a teenth, yo.
- Tucker!

276
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,380
- Come on, help a brother out.
- Tucker!

277
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:08,050
- Will you shut the damn door?
- We don't sell to strangers.

278
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,553
- Tucker!
- Get off the porch, asshole.

279
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,222
- Will you shut the door?
- All right already!

280
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,349
Tucker!

281
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,093
Guess we'll go with Plan A, then.

282
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,904
- Pop the trunk, would you?
- Why?

283
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,324
- There's something in there I need.
- And what would that be?

284
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,910
I'm getting those pricks
out of that house.

285
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,996
Oh, your first attempt
being such a wild success?

286
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,583
You may know this whole
Pl sit-in-the-car business...

287
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,211
...but I know meth-heads.

288
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,389
What are you doing?

289
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,599
Digging.

290
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,144
Why?

291
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,522
You know why.

292
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,816
How deep are you going?

293
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,820
I don't know.
How deep do you think it is?

294
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,200
Pretty deep.

295
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:50,337
Hey, you mind taking over
for a minute?

296
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,841
Yeah, sure.

297
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:08,522
- Hey, mind if I use your john?
- Yeah.

298
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,550
Tucker.

299
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,986
Tucker!

300
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,401
Who the hell are you?

301
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,278
- I just...
- Who the hell are you?

302
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,824
It's cool. Hey, I'm a friend of Tucker's.

303
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:05,663
- What do you want?
- I just wanna buy some of the blue.

304
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,623
It's not for sale.

305
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,418
I know you were selling it earlier...

306
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,631
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Tucker told me.

307
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,884
Yeah, Tucker needs to learn
to keep his damn mouth shut.

308
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,220
Tucker! Tucker!

309
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,350
So you gonna hook me up?

310
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,813
Don't have enough for all
of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!

311
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,276
You know, I think he's outside.
You wanna just go outside...

312
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:40,698
- Tucker! Tucker!
- Hey, hey. Let's go find Tucker.

313
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,616
Okay? Let's go outside.

314
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:47,413
I don't have enough for you,
all right?

315
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:52,668
Yeah. yeah. Yeah, I get it. Okay.

316
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:57,131
- I don't wanna start any trouble.
- Trouble? What's that mean? Trouble?

317
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,384
No, no, no.
I'm just saying we're cool, okay?

318
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,802
- We're good.
- What?

319
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,305
You can't know that.
What does that mean?

320
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,767
You don't put thoughts in my head.
You don't put thoughts in my head.

321
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,313
- Absolutely. You're right. You're right.
- Tucker?

322
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,236
You...

323
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,023
Here you go, Maria.

324
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,733
Veronica.

325
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,069
Ilia, gracias.

326
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,120
I missed that one.
I'm sure it was good.

327
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,050
Wait, where you taking them?

328
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:27,388
- Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?
- I'm putting them on a bus.

329
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,557
- Why? What bus?
- One that takes them back to Honduras.

330
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,268
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.

331
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:38,107
Wait, wait. This was my idea.
Don't punish them.

332
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,151
You tell Gus to blame me, not them.

333
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,654
He does.

334
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,513
Give us a minute, will you?

335
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,028
We won't be too long.

336
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,997
The crew that hit our truck
gave away the cargo...

337
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,166
...to a couple local nobodies.

338
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,919
Very disciplined of them,
not keeping anything for themselves.

339
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,881
It was all about sending a message.

340
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,842
Which they did, literally.

341
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,553
It was written on the bucket lid.

342
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,972
"Ready to talk?"

343
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,434
That, I believe,
is the English translation.

344
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,940
I know you're not really asking
for advice.

345
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:07,821
But let me hire 10, 15 more
good operators.

346
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,741
Then we hit them hard.
Hit them where they live.

347
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:15,496
No. This war stays cold for now.

348
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,377
What about their message?
What's the answer?

349
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:30,219
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.

350
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,306
How did he do today?

351
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,872
I hear you can handle yourself.

352
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,792
I guess.

353
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,378
Good night.

354
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,880
Hey, excuse me?

355
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,467
Why me?

356
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,097
I like to think I see things in people.

357
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:45,085
Slow down.
The car is not going anywhere.

358
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,508
- Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.

359
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,511
- Hi.
- Hey.

360
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,976
- So did you see what's in the driveway?
- There you go.

361
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,896
Yeah, I saw.

362
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,939
Hey.

363
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,194
So that's yours, huh?

364
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,821
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

365
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,324
Well, that was very nice of him.

366
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,618
Yeah.

367
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,954
I know it looks like...

368
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,917
...well, awesome, but it's super safe.

369
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,543
Dad made sure.

370
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:30,047
And I promise
to always go the speed limit. Or below.

371
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,381
Way below.

372
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:36,136
And it gets great gas mileage.

373
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:42,267
So Dad said I can take it around
the block a few times. That okay?

374
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,895
Just around the block.

375
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,106
Yeah. Just around the block.

376
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,152
- And be careful, okay?
- I will.

377
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,446
Bye.

378
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,869
It's really... it's really great
to have you home, Mom.

379
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,879
Hey, seriously, be careful. Okay?

380
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,965
- I will.
- Okay.

381
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,068
I guess we should talk.

382
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,405
Well, I think you said plenty
the other day.

383
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,450
Look, about that, it just...

384
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,704
Did you get the car wash keys?

385
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,500
Yes. Yes. Here.

386
00:43:54,924 --> 00:44:01,221
Skyler, I may have
overstated things earlier...

387
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:05,559
...and I'm sorry to be so forward.

388
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:10,063
But I just...
l want you to know something.

389
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,898
I want you to...

390
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,776
I need you to understand...

391
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,154
...that you are safe.

392
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:22,701
You, Junior, Holly.
You are completely safe.

393
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:27,748
Everything that I do, everything...

394
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,168
...I do it to protect this family.

395
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:37,007
So buying that car,
that was protecting your family?

396
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,346
Okay. I...

397
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,267
All right, maybe it's a little flashy,
but he needed a car...

398
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:52,564
...and I'm his father, and I should
be able to get what he wants.

399
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,861
It goes back.

400
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,613
Tomorrow.

401
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,283
Skyler, it will crush him.

402
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,372
That car directly contradicts
our story.

403
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,084
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family...

404
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,128
...it means protecting the story.

405
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,215
What do you think the neighbors
are gonna say, Walt?

406
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,925
What about Hank and Marie?

407
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,012
How about the IRS?
What were you thinking, walt?

408
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,975
I was thinking that I wanted
to do something nice for my son.

409
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,361
Look.

410
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,866
I just worry that he'll blame you
for this.

411
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,372
Oh, he will.

412
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,417
Once again,
he'll blame his bitch mother...

413
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,546
...for taking away
what his loving father has given him...

414
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:00,215
...so thanks for that.

415
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,886
But you know what, Walt?

416
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,639
Someone has to protect this family...

417
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:11,101
...from the man
who protects this family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
