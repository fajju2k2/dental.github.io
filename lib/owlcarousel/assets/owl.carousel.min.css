0:06,696 --> 00:40:07,905
Welcome back.

449
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,324
- Looking good, Marie.
- Thanks, Steve.

450
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:14,661
- Good to see you. How you doing?
- He's fine. We can take it from here.

451
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,830
- Yeah.
- If you wanna hold his elbow.

452
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:21,085
No, no, no. You keep your mitts off me.
I'm good. I'm good.

453
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,380
Hey.

454
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,383
Good luck.

455
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,808
Let's go, we're running late.
Come on.

456
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:45,275
Hank, seeing you walk in here, I can't
tell you what that means to all of us.

457
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,612
Your progress, it's incredible.

458
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,116
Yeah, well, chalk it up to clean living
and vitamin pills.

459
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,911
- Steve tell you his news?
- What?

460
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,163
Finally got your period?

461
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,207
I made GS-14.

462
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,084
Wow, that's all right, man.

463
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:05,129
Next stop: Washington, D.C.
Sitting behind a desk...

464
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,756
...papers piled so high,
you can't see over them.

465
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,758
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

466
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,969
Seriously, congratulations, buddy.

467
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,554
Thanks.

468
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,056
Steve said you might have something
for us.

469
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,226
Yeah, maybe.
You guys are gonna have to tell me.

470
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,437
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

471
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,897
APD detective?

472
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,316
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case.

473
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,944
The victim's a 34-year-old
male Caucasian...

474
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,238
...by the name of Gale Boetticher.

475
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,700
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door...

476
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:39,329
...takes a bullet to the face
from a person or persons unknown.

477
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,417
Now, this Gale Boetticher
is a bona fide chemistry genius.

478
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:46,628
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, right?

479
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:51,091
And, well, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

480
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,136
Vegan, sandals and socks
kind of guy.

481
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:59,558
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number-one meth cook.

482
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:04,855
And what caught my eye
is his specialty product is blue.

483
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,107
So, what are you thinking?

484
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,650
This is your Heisenberg?

485
